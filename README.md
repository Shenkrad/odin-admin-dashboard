## 🧱 Description

The purpose of this project is to build an **admin dashboard interface** using only **HTML and CSS**, without any frameworks or external libraries, mimicking a modern control panel layout.

This assignment reinforces key concepts such as:

- Advanced use of **CSS Grid** for complex page layouts  
- **Responsive design** for different screen sizes  
- Control of **spacing and alignment** using `gap`, `auto-fit`, `auto-fill`, and `minmax()`  
- Creation of **reusable components** (cards, panels, buttons, sections)  
- Clean HTML structure and **separation of concerns** in CSS  
- Handling **overflow**, **text clamping**, and visual hierarchy
